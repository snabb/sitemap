The Go package sitemap provides tools for creating XML sitemaps
and sitemap indexes and writing them to an `io.Writer` (such as
`http.ResponseWriter`).

Please see https://www.sitemaps.org/ for description of sitemap contents.

The package implements `io.WriterTo` and `io.ReaderFrom` interfaces.

Yes. This is yet another sitemap package for Go. I was not happy with any
of the existing packages.
