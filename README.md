The Go package sitemap provides tools for creating XML sitemaps
and sitemap indexes and writing them to an io.Writer (such as
http.ResponseWriter).

Please see https://www.sitemaps.org/ for description of sitemap contents.

The package implements io.WriterTo and io.ReaderFrom interfaces.

Yes. This is yet another sitemap package for Go. I was not happy with any
of the existing packages.
